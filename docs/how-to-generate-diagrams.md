# How to generate diagrams

Proxy diagrams should be generated by preference with [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com).
PlantUML is a tool that generates UML in different image formats from a textual
description.

Diagrams can be generated directly in a browser at 
http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml, or locally at
http://plantuml.com/download.
